## Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **[Web dev projects](#)**: All of my web dev projects use a multitude of different languages like HTML ,Javascript , CSS , PHP.

## Tutorials
Here are some tutorials I've followed or created:
- **[Tutorial 1](#)**: Brief description of the tutorial.

## Scripts
Here are some useful scripts I've written:
- **[Script 1](#)**: Brief description of the script.

## How to Use
To explore any project or script, navigate to its folder and read the `README.md` file for instructions on how to set it up and run it.
Those that does not have any purely runs in the ide .
For COS 344 you have to run docker on the folder and then from there atatch the container to your ide and run from there.
For My City Management simulator it is still in development and thus only runs in Unreal Engine 5.

still need to add some documentation for a few projects and will be done soon.
